<p>The aim of this program is to provide a tool for technology or process 
control by computer. However there could be different use cases. The program 
consists of a runtime environment that interprets the application. The 
application determine the the logic (behaviour) and is written as a simple 
text, or in xml format.

<p>The building blocks of the application are modules and resources. Modules 
are means to provide a data processing. Resource serves as the hardware 
resource encapsulation. One resource can be accessed by multiple modules. Data 
are transfered between modules via {@link control4j.Signal} objects. The 
modules are of three types, input modules, output modules and process modules. 
Input modules have only inputs and do not provide any output back into the 
runtime environment. These modules mostly encapsulate output into the 
technology, or output for the HMI interface. Output modules in turn provide 
only outputs. They mainly get input from technology into the runtime 
environment for later processing. Process modules have both inputs and 
outputs. These are modules that process data according to some algorithm and 
provide processed data back to the runtime environment.

<p>The runtime environment is highly inspired by 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_controller">
Programmable Logic Controllers</a> (PLCs). Equally as PLCs it is working in 
cycles of constant length. The output modules are evaluated at the start of 
the cycle to gather the outcomes of the technology. Then the process modules 
are evaluated. The process module is executed when all of its input data are 
available. This condition excludes the presence of cycles between modules. 
Finally, the input modules are executed to provide output back into the 
technologz. If evaluation of the entire application is finished before the 
entered period of the cycle, the runtime environment is suspended for the rest 
of the period.

<p>The entry point of the program is the class {@link control4j.Control}. It 
expects a name of the file with the application description as the commad line 
argument. So the program may be executed as follows:

<p><code>java control4j.Control app.conf</code>

<h2>After the control4j is run</h2>

<p>The process after the {@link control4j.Control} has been run, may be devided
into two phases.
<ol>
  <li>Project loading: all of the files that are included under the specified
      project are read; instances of all of the modules, resources, gui objects
      are created and configured; modules are ordered and the whole project
      is checked.
  <li>The control loop is run: output modules are executed, process modules
      are executed and input modules are excecuted; and again; and again ...
</ol>

<h3>Project loading</h3>

<p>Even the project loging phase consists of several steps.
<ol>
  <li>First of all, the instance of {@link control4j.ControlLoop} class
      is created, but not run yet. It is becouse during the project loading
      it is neccessary to configure the control loop object.
  <li>The project file is loaded. For more information 
      see {@link control4j.project}.
  <li>All of the files which are referenced from the project file are loaded.
      Loaders can be found under the {@link control4j.application} package.
  <li>Than project is built. It means that instances of modules and resources
      are created and everything is interconnected and sorted. For details
      see {@link control4j.ApplicationBuilder}.
  <li>And finally, the consistency of the whole project is checked. 
      See {@link control4j.ApplicationCheck}.
</ol>
If some error is found out during each of these steps, program is terminated
and next step is not performed. Error handling is provided by the
{@link control4j.ErrorManager} class.

<h3>Control loop</h3>

<h2>Units</h2>

<p>If the application works with data and signals that are measured somewhere
in the technology and the data represents temperature, preasure, flow, etc., 
it is typically necessary to handle units of these signals. Therefore the
basic datatype the {@link control4j.Signal} class has a unit property attached.
The unit property may be set in two ways. If the module, which is the source
of some signal, knows the unit, then it is responsible for setting the unit
property of the output signal. If some module reads data from AD converter,
for example, which measure electric current in mA, then the module should set 
the unit of output signal to mA. Sometimes the module is not able to determine
the unit of output signal. If you multiply the input signal by a constant, for
instance, the unit may change, but the only developer of the application is
able to derive how. That is why, there is a second option for unit settings.
The unit may be stated in the application description in the signal 
declaration. In cases when the unit is set even by the module and 
simoultaneously it is mentioned in the declaration of the signal, the unit 
set by the module is prefered.
