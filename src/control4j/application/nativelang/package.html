<p>There are objects for loading an application which is written in the 
c4j language in this package. There is a complete datastructure needed
to store the application together with the loader???

<p>The root object, which holds the rest of the objects is Application.

<p>All of the objects are prepared to hold the so called declaration
reference. This kind of information should be in the human readable
form and should be sufficient to identify such objected whenever 
necessary.
